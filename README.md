Users of the android 3D model viewer "cgmv" app can raise issues here

## Guidelines
 - Provide as much detail as possible.  Including screenshots and videos can greatly increase the ability to understand the discussion.
 - Provide detailed, step-by-step instructions to reproduce any problems encountered.  Assume the person reading has no clue about the details of your environment...
 - If providing links to 3D model files, where possible please attach model file directly to the issue description; external links have a way of deteriorating over time so future readers may not be able to test the model originally provided
